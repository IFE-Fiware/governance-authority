## Description
This project contains the configuration files required for deploying an application using Helm and ArgoCD. 
- the deployment will be done by master helm chart allowing to deploy a **Governance Authority** agent using a single command.
- templates of values.yaml files used inside *Integration* environment under `app-values` folder

## Installation

The deployment is based on master helm chart which, when applied on Kubernetes cluster, should deploy the Authority to it using ArgoCD. 

### Prerequisites

#### Create the Namespace
Once the namespace variable is set, you can create the namespace using the following kubectl command:

`kubectl create namespace authority1`

#### Verify the Namespace
To ensure that the namespace was created successfully, run the following command:

`kubectl get namespaces`
<br/>This will list all the namespaces in your cluster, and you should see the one you just created listed.

#### Vault related tasks

All the secrets are now generated and stored automatically on deployment of Common namespace.

### Deployment using ArgoCD

You can easily deploy the agent using ArgoCD. All the values mentioned in the sections below you can input in ArgoCD deployment. The repoURL gets the package directly from code.europa.eu.
targetRevision is the package version. 

When you create it, you set up the values below (example values)

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: 'authority1-deployer'               # name of the deploying app in argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: 'https://code.europa.eu/api/v4/projects/902/packages/helm/stable'
    path: '""'
    targetRevision: 1.3.1                   # version of package
    helm:
      values: |
        values:
          branch: v1.3.1                    # branch of repo with values - for released version it should be the release branch
        project: default                    # Project to which the namespace is attached
        namespaceTag: authority1            # identifier of deployment and part of fqdn
        domainSuffix: int.simpl-europe.eu   # last part of fqdn
        argocd:
          appname: authority1               # name of generated argocd app 
          namespace: argocd                 # namespace of your argocd
        cluster:
          address: https://kubernetes.default.svc
          namespace: authority1             # where the app will be deployed
          commonToolsNamespace: common      # namespace where main monitoring stack is deployed
          issuer: dev-int-dns01             # certificate issuer name
        hashicorp:
          service: "https://vault.common.domainsuffix"  # link to your vault ingress (apply domain suffix)
          role: dev-int-role                # role created in vault for access
          secretEngine: dev-int             # container for secrets in your vault
        monitoring:
          enabled: true                     # you can set it to false if you don't have common monitoring stack
    chart: authority
  destination:
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
    namespace: authority1                    # where the package will be deployed
```

### Manual deployment

#### Files preparation

Another way for deployment, is to unpack the released package to a folder on a host where you have kubectl and helm available and configured. 

There is basically one file that you need to modify - values.yaml. 
There are a couple of variables you need to replace - described below. The rest you don't need to change. 

```
values:
  repo_URL: https://code.europa.eu/simpl/simpl-open/development/agents/governance-authority.git   # repo URL
  branch: v1.3.1                    # branch of repo with values - for released version it should be the release branch

project: default                                  # Project to which the namespace is attached
namespaceTag: authority1                          # identifier of deployment and part of fqdn
domainSuffix: int.simpl-europe.eu                 # last part of fqdn

argocd:
  appname: authority1                             # name of generated argocd app 
  namespace: argocd                               # namespace of your argocd

cluster:
  address: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  namespace: authority1                           # where the package will be deployed
  commonToolsNamespace: common                    # namespace where main monitoring stack is deployed
  issuer: dev-int-dns01                           # certificate issuer name

hashicorp:
  service: "https://vault.common.domainsuffix"    # link to your vault ingress (apply domain suffix)
  role: dev-int-role                              # role created in vault for access
  secretEngine: dev-int                           # container for secrets in your vault

monitoring:
  enabled: true                     # you can set it to false if you don't have common monitoring stack
```

#### Deployment

After you have prepared the values file, you can start the deployment. 
Use the command prompt. Proceed to the folder where you have the Chart.yaml file and execute the following command. The dot at the end is crucial - it points to current folder to look for the chart. 

Now you can deploy the agent:

`helm install authority . `

## Additional steps

In the current version, the automatic onboarding process has already been implemented using: init-authority-job.
For this reason, manual onboarding activities are no longer necessary.

### Monitoring

Filebeat components for monitoring are included in this release.   
Their deployment can be disabled by switching the value monitoring.enabled to false.

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during deployment, check the following:

- Ensure that ArgoCD is properly set up and running.
- Verify that the namespace exists in your Kubernetes cluster.
- Check the ArgoCD application logs and Helm error messages for specific issues.
